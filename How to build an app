# How to Build an App

* Create a new respository on GitHub
* Clone above respository onto VS Code
* Build a Docker-compose.yaml file to start up environment
* May need separate Dockerfiles to build containere environments
* Log into container with
>> docker exec -it requests bash
* pip freeze to get requirements and copy into requirements.txt file
>> pip freeze
* mypy to check for typing
* Learn python
* Write python with PEP8 styling (to improve readability) - https://realpython.com/python-pep8/
* Linter for better styling
* mypi for hint type checking 
* Add a devcontainer.json - here you can add what python version you want for linters and so on

Notes:
If Docker cannot build the container (eg "network [network long name] not found), try this:
>> docker-compose up --force-recreate -d
