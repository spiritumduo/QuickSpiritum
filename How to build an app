# How to Build an App

1. Create a new respository on GitHub
2. Clone above respository onto VS Code
3. Build a Docker-compose.yaml file to start up environment
4. May need separate Dockerfiles to build containere environments
5. Log into container with
>> docker exec -it requests bash
6. pip freeze to get requirements and copy into requirements.txt file
>> pip freeze
7. mypy to check for typing

Notes:
If Docker cannot build the container (eg "network [network long name] not found), try this:
>> docker-compose up --force-recreate -d
